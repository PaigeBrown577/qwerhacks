# qwerhacks 2021

## Project Description
This project, called Calmify, was created by myself and my partner, Christina Tong, for a hackathon in Januaray 2021 called QWER Hacks. It is built using React. Calmify won Third Place in the Healthcare Track.

Project inspriation: It can be hard to make time for self-care and check in on your mental health, so we created a website to help users become more in tune with themselves. The goal of Calmify is to normalize self-care and to encourage users to take just a few minutes out of their day to reflect and do something for the sake of their own enjoyment and happiness.

The website has a daily rating page where you can rate how you're feeling on a scale from 1 to 5. It has the option to take users to a page where they can reflect on their emotions for the day and look into some self-care activities. There is also calendar where you can see your ratings from the past week and also reflect on what activities you did to improve your mood and practice self-care.

What's next for Calmify: We hope to add more interactive features, include more self-care activities/cards to make website more dynamic, have the ability to reflect on mood and activities over longer periods of time, allow the user to save activities they enjoyed doing, add notifications to remind users to self-care, and fully deploy the website.
